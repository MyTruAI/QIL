# Q-Auth: Quantum Bio-Authentication

Q-Auth is a quantum-powered bio-authentication system that integrates biometric data with quantum information processing to create a highly secure authentication method. 

## Features

- **Biometric Input**: Supports fingerprint scanning and facial recognition.
- **Quantum Key Generation**: Converts biometric data into a quantum key.
- **Quantum Circuit Simulation**: Uses Qiskit to simulate quantum circuits and perform authentication.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Provides real-time feedback to the user during the authentication process.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MyTruAI/QIL/Q-Auth.git
    cd Q-Auth
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the application.

## Usage

- Enter your biometric data in the input field (simulated for now).
- Click "Authenticate" to verify your identity using quantum bio-authentication.

## Future Improvements

- **Hardware Integration**: Replace simulated biometric input with actual fingerprint and facial recognition hardware.
- **Enhanced Security**: Implement additional security measures such as multi-factor authentication.
